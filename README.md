EV Energy and Oil Displacement Analysis in Europe
Introduction

This project explores the impact of electric vehicles (EVs) on energy consumption and oil displacement in Europe. It analyzes historical data on EV circulation, charging infrastructure, electricity consumption (GWh), and oil displacement, as well as projections up to 2030. The goal is to understand the energy and environmental implications of EV adoption in Europe.

Data
A dataset was used containing historical and projected EV data in Europe, with the following key metrics:
Vehicles in circulation – number of EVs per country/year
Charging points – availability of public charging infrastructure
Electricity consumption (GWh) – energy used by EVs
Oil displacement (million lge) – estimated gasoline/oil not consumed due to EV adoption

Comments & Challenges:
The dataset contains both historical and projection data, requiring careful filtering to distinguish actual vs. forecasted values.
Some countries have sparse historical data.
Units are inconsistent (GWh, million lge, Vehicles), so conversions and comparisons were necessary.

Strengths:
Provides a broad European view with historical and future projections.
Includes multiple metrics, allowing analysis of both energy and environmental impact.

Weaknesses:
Limited granularity for some countries.

Projections are model-based, so assumptions may not perfectly reflect future conditions.

Questions to Answer

1. EV Circulation Growth
Question: How many EVs are currently in circulation, and how does this vary between countries?
Conclusion: Germany and the Netherlands lead in EV adoption, with steady growth over the past decade. Bar charts show yearly EV growth, highlighting trends in top European countries.

2. Charging Infrastructure
Question: Is the charging infrastructure keeping pace with EV adoption?
Conclusion: Charging points are increasing, but projections suggest further expansion is needed to match the growth of EVs.

3. Energy Consumption
Question: How much electricity do EVs consume, historically and projected?
Conclusion: EVs consumed ~35,400 GWh in Europe up to 2024. Projections indicate ~168,624 GWh could be consumed by 2030, showing a significant future energy demand.

4. Oil Displacement
Question: How much oil consumption is avoided thanks to EVs?
Conclusion: EV adoption has displaced ~42.4 billion liters of oil historically, with an expected additional ~86.9 billion liters by 2030. This is equivalent to:
86.9 million cars for 1 year
1,450 jumbo jets for 1 year
7,940 large cargo ships for 1 year

Methodology
Data Cleaning:
Filtered historical vs. projection data
Ensured consistent units
Handled missing values or empty rows

Data Analysis:
Aggregated EV counts by country/year
Calculated total electricity consumption and oil displacement
Built cumulative and yearly summaries

Visualization:
Line charts for yearly trends
Bar charts for country comparisons
Stacked area charts for cumulative impact


Conclusions
EV adoption in Europe is growing rapidly, with some countries leading in both vehicles and charging infrastructure.
Electricity demand will significantly increase due to EV growth, highlighting energy system challenges.
EVs contribute substantially to reducing oil consumption, with massive environmental and economic implications.

Further Questions
How will different EV adoption scenarios affect future electricity demand and grid load?
What is the environmental impact of producing the additional electricity for EVs?
How can charging infrastructure planning be optimized to match future EV adoption?
